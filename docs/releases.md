# Releases

There's multiple releases of XCP-ng. In general, one CR (Current Release) and one LTSR (Long Term Support Release).

## CR (Current Release)

Using the CR version is relevant if:

* you want to enjoy the most recent features and enhancements
* you want to have the latest hardware support
* you want to enjoy more performances
* it's not a problem to do an upgrade twice a year or so

If you prefer to be more conservative, go for our [LTS release](releases.md#ltsr-long-term-support-release).

:::tip
Right now, the current release (8.2) is also the LTSR. As soon there's a new release after that, for example 8.3, this new version will be the CR, and 8.2 will stay as the LTS.

## LTSR (Long Term Support Release)

Using the LTSR version is relevant if:

* you want to be sure the system will stay stable
* you want to have all security fixes without doing major upgrades every year
* you want a predictable migration path on a longer timeframe
* you don't care about new features coming for the next years
